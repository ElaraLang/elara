# Syntax

Elara's syntax is primarily inspired by Haskell and F#. It aims to be lightweight, concise, and flexible.
It is **layout-sensitive**, meaning that indentation is significant and used to denote code blocks.

This section covers the various syntactic constructs in Elara:

## [Lexical Structure](./syntax/lexical-structure.md)

Rules for identifiers, literals, keywords, and the layout system.

## [Comments](./syntax/comments.md)

How to write single-line and multi-line comments.

## [Annotations](./syntax/annotations.md)

Attaching metadata to constructs, such as specifying operator precedence.
