# Elara

Elara is a multi-paradigm, primarily-functional programming language targeting the JVM. It features a Haskell & F#
inspired syntax, a complete Hindley-Milner type system, functional purity enforcement, and can interoperate with Java
code.

Elara is currently a WIP, and is not yet ready for use.
See [specification/specification.pdf](the specification)for some examples and a very incomplete specification
