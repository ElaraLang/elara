# Elara

Elara is a multi-paradigm, primarily-functional programming language targetting the JVM. It features a Haskell & F#
inspired syntax, a complete Hindley-Milner type system, functional purity enforcement, and can interoperate with Java
code.

Elara is currently a WIP, and is not yet ready for use.

Roadmap:

- [x] Lexing
- [x] Parsing
- [x] Type inference
- [ ] Type checking
- [ ] Compiling
- [ ] Possible Interpreter
- [ ] Standard Library
- [ ] Interoperability with Java

Language Features:

- [x] Immutable variables
- [ ] Mutable variables
- [x] Operator overloading
- [ ] Custom operator fixity and precedence
- [x] Function definition
- [x] Function application
- [x] Lambda expressions
- [x] If-else expressions
- [x] Recursion
- [x] Pattern matching
- [x] Type inference
- [ ] Type classes
- [ ] Monad syntax sugar (do notation, computation expressions)
- [ ] OOP Features coming soon (classes, etc)
