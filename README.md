# Elara

[![CI](https://github.com/ElaraLang/elara/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ElaraLang/elara/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

Elara is a multi-paradigm, primarily-functional programming language targeting the JVM. It features a Haskell & F#
inspired syntax, a complete Hindley-Milner type system, functional purity enforcement, and can interoperate with Java
code.

Elara is currently a WIP, and is not yet ready for use.
See [the specification](specification/specification.pdf) for some examples and a very incomplete specification

## Library Credit ❤️

Elara couldn't have been possible without many different open-source projects, and while I can't possibly credit them all here are the most important ones:

* [Grace](https://github.com/Gabriella439/grace) - Without this resource I would've never figured out type checking
